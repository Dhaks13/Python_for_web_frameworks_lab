# File Handling

### 1. Vowels and Consonants
Read multiple lines of text from the user and store it in a file called “INPUT.txt”. Read
each character one by one from the file and store vowel characters in “VOWEL.txt’
and consonant in “CONSONANT.txt”. Print all the file contents.

### 2. Student Details
Write a program to show the details of the students who are all scored the total mark > 250.
Create a List of List to store the N number of students' details such as Rollno,
name, Mark1, Mark2, Mark3. Write all the students' details in “Data.csv” using an
user defined function. Include another user defined function called extract() to read
the student details if the total mark is above 250 and store it in another
“OUTPUT.csv” file. Print both the file contents.

### 3. Employee Details
Read the employee details from the user and store it in a nested dictionary called
empl_sal dictionary ( with id as outer dictionary key and name & salary as the inner
dictionary key). Create a binary file “salary.DAT” from the empl_sal dictionary. Write
a user defined function to read the contents of the file “salary.DAT” and displays the
details of those employees whose salary is above 20000.
